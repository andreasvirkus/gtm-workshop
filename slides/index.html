            <h2>Google Tag Manager</h2>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>GTM is a free tool, allowing marketers to implement
                and make tracking changes without the need of dev-interference.
              </p>
              <p>It used to be about devs manually/hard-coding tags or snippets
                of code per trackable event/element.
              </p>
              <p>When you use a 3rd-party tracking program to collect information,
                such as Google Analytics, each program requires its own individual
                code. If you have a webpage that tracks information using three
                different programs, you would need three separate codes on each
                page of that site. With Google Tag Manager, you‚Äôre given one standardized
                code to place on your web page. All programs can then be deployed
                through that one GTM code and managed behind the scenes on a simple
                dashboard.</p>
              <p>As the needs of your website change, new programs and program
                updates can be made through the Google Tag Manager dashboard,
                without ever having to dive into the code on the web pages themselves.
              </p>

              <p>Another benefit of Google Tag Manager is that it allows you to
                test and debug any changes that you make before posting the changes
                live on your website. After the changes have been tested and
                perfected, Google Tag Manager makes it possible to implement all
                changes at the same time, ensuring efficient, more exact, and immediate
                tracking capabilities, ultimately giving you clean data.</p>
              <p>You also get version control, since you can name/tag your releases
                and publish a previous one</p>

              Let's go through the components one-by-one.

          <section>
            <h2>Accounts</h2>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Top-level component of GTM, typically 1 account
              is needed per company.</p>
              <p>Accounts can include a company or organization
                with lots of websites (such as a retail chain with
                different websites for each location), down to a
                small local company with only one site.</p>
              <p>GA existing account works for GTM, but you don't
                actually need GA to use GTM (Keen.io).
              </p>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Containers</h2>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Containers hold all the tags for a specific website
                or mobile application. If you only have one website,
                you‚Äôll only need one container. If you have multiple
                related websites (such as various retail locations),
                you can create different containers for each.</p>
              <p>Containers are the most important function of Google
                Tag Manager. They are the bucket where all your tags
                live. Containers keep all your important tags and
                programs in one organized container; allowing you
                to manage, configure, and deploy your programs and
                tags through one platform. Containers hold everything
                for a website. This is the function that allows you
                to run all of these on one platform, providing accessibility,
                convenience, and cost-effective tag management.</p>
              <p>You can label your containers and its usually a good
                practise to label them after the website/app it represents.</p>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Folders</h2>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>As containers grow, they can fill up and make it difficult
                to feel organized and keep track of all the jumbled components.
                You can use folders to organize the contents of your
                containers into groupings.</p>
              <p>A folder is an especially great tool if you have different
                teams working on different campaigns. You can label the
                folders by teams (ex. marketing vs. sales), by type (ex.
                Google Analytics tags vs. AdWords tags), or by project
                (ex. new ad campaign, retargeting campaign). The capabilities
                of Google Tag Manager are vast, and folders can help you stay
                organized as you build your containers.</p>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>tags</h2>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>The goal of a tag is to give marketers a better understanding
                of what visitors are doing on their website. In order to track
                activity, you need a snippet of code on every page of your website.
                This section of code that allows for information tracking is called
                a tag. When a tag gets added to a web page, it permits tracking
                on that page, enabling data collection and reporting. Based on
                a user‚Äôs commands, a tag can tell you specific, detailed information
                about performance on that page.</p>
              <p>Tags can track all types of information about a web page, such
                as conversions, traffic, button clicks, or other metrics needed
                to optimize online performance. They also enable detailed tracking,
                analyzing, and reporting, giving marketers real data on which to
                base their marketing decisions.</p>
              <p>Tag use cases:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>For retargeting after a visitor performs a defined action
                  (like landing on a loan page).</li>
                <li>To know what page a visitor is on when they perform a specific
                  action ‚Äì like signing up for the newsletter or downloading something.</li>
                <li>To gather detailed traffic information, such as visits to a particular webpage.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Google provides templates for its programs, commonly sed tags and
                third-party programs (also allowing you to create custom tags).
              </p>
              <p>Some common tags: google analytics, AdWords conversion tracking,
                HotJar, FB, LinkedIn, Twitter...</p>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Triggers</h2>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>When a trigger is attached to a tag, it tells the tag the
                conditions that must be met for the tag to fire. When a tag
                ‚Äòfires‚Äô, it enables its respective 3rd party tracking program to
                start tracking information. A tag must have at least one trigger
                in order to fire at all.</p>
              <p>Once you‚Äôve added a tag, you will be able to set your tag
                triggers. You‚Äôll need to enter in a few details about the tag,
                then you can set the triggers (or the ‚Äòrules‚Äô) for that tag.</p>
              <p>Example:: f a marketer wants a tag to fire when a visitor lands
                on the homepage, they would set up a trigger for that homepage.
                If the URL of the homepage ends in ‚Äú/home‚Äù they would select URL
                as the variable, ‚Äúcontains‚Äù as the operator, and enter ‚Äú/home‚Äù
                into the value.</p>

            <h2>Data layer</h2>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Rather than referencing variables, transaction information,
                page categories, and other important signals scattered throughout
                your page, Google Tag Manager is designed to easily reference
                information that you put in this data layer. However, explicitly
                declaring the data layer is optional and if you choose not to
                implement the data layer, you can still access values from the page
                using the Variables feature, but you cannot use events without the
                data layer. Implementing the data layer with variables and
                associated values, as opposed to waiting for those variables to
                load throughout the page, ensures that they will be available as
                soon as you need them to fire tags.</p>

              <p>
                Google Tag Manager provides a special data layer variable called
                an event that is used within JavaScript event listeners to initiate
                tag firing when a user interacts with website elements such as a
                button. For example, you may want to fire a conversion tracking tag
                when a user clicks the Submit button on a newsletter signup form.
                Events may be called based on user interaction with website elements
                such as links, buttons, components of a Flash-driven menu system, or
                based on other JavaScript (e.g. time delays, etc.).
